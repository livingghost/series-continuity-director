"""Validate declared narrative intent and its typed references.

The shared document records whichever concerns, agents, organizing threads,
chapters, promises, questions and knowledge the author has declared. Its root
arrays may be empty; declared references must still resolve. It does not select
cast size, genre, theme, dramatic structure or the creative project's entry
point. World rules, design decisions and detailed personas remain in their
owning documents rather than being inferred from these tables.

A promise tracks an intended audience setup, a question an open inquiry, and a
knowledge entry who learned a fact and when. They are optional authored links,
not obligations for every work. Chapter order connects this declaration to
scene plots and, when used, a state timeline. Structural validity and approval
hashes do not establish semantic coherence, completed writing or user adoption.
