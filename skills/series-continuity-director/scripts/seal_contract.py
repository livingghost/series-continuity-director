"""Seal the narrative contract against the files it publishes, in the order that stops.

The contract publishes the hash of each file that answers it, and one of those
files carries the contract's digest, so the two feed each other. The cut is that
the digest is taken over the contract with the published block removed. That
fixes the order: settle the prose, write the digest into the reader that carries
it, then publish the hashes of the files as they now are. The last step moves a
reader's hash but not the digest, so a second run changes nothing.

Which files are published is read from the block itself, so adding one is a
matter of adding its line to the block by hand and running this.

    python scripts/seal_contract.py            seal, and say what moved
    python scripts/seal_contract.py --check    say whether sealing would move anything, exit 1 if so
