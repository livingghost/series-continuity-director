"""Create, rename and remove the files the narrative directory holds.

A naming rule nobody can run is a naming rule, and a series finds a persona,
a place, a faction, a system, an object or a term by its file name. Writing one
by hand means writing the front matter by hand, and a file whose id and name
disagree is found by nothing.

Renaming is the case that has to be a command. An id appears in the file, in the
narrative's persona pointers, in every scene plot that happens at that place, and
in the references other files declare. Renaming by hand means finding all of them.

Every command writes into one project, and refuses a directory with no
project-manifest.json or one inside the installed suite.

    python scripts/narrative_entity.py --project <dir> add location kanda-station \\
        --name "Kanda station, east side"
    python scripts/narrative_entity.py --project <dir> add persona c01-school \\
        --character C01 --phase school
    python scripts/narrative_entity.py --project <dir> rename kanda-station kanda-east
