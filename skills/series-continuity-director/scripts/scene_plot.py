"""Validate a scene's presented material and supported realization.

A scene declares its setting, viewpoint, purpose and beats. Sourced statements
identify the beats supporting placement, preservation and realization in shots,
pages or passages. Context-only material cannot silently become visible output.

The scene can have no cast, dialogue, organizing threads or persistent changes.
A turn and named dramatic structure are optional; a depicted condition can
persist. A unit's focal_beat key points to its focal visible beat
without requiring transformation. Declared references and supplied typed fields
remain checked even when their containing lists may be empty.

The plot names no target model. Validation and approval establish a supported
artifact contract, not its artistic adequacy or the semantic coherence of linked
world, design and persona prose.
